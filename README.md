Android app support a dark theme with automatic switching during night time.


There is full support for tablets.


If you want to leave the old date when editing a place then on mobile phones you need to click on the date and on the PC hold down the `Shift` key when you click on the done button.


There is a 5-megabyte limit for notes (except PC), you can monitor the available storage in the application settings.


On Android, devices without a compass are supported — map rotation is based on navigation coordinates. If you are riding public transport backwards, switch the movement mode to reverse.


Switch the movement mode by tapping on the remaining time, so that the displayed time corresponds to the selected type of movement.

## Setup
### Windows
The Windows application acts as a server app with which the mobile application synchronizes.

### Android
Install `EasyPlaces.apk`, select automatic IP address search or enter a reserved permanent IP of your computer (more on this below). If your router assigns the following IP addresses: `192.168.0.0/15`, `192.168.0.100/115`, `192.168.1.0/15`, `192.168.1.100/115`, `192.168.2.0/15`, `192.168.3.0/15`, then you can simply enable automatic IP address search, and the application will automatically detect your computer.

### P2P mobile app synchronization (optional, in case of problems)
Check Windows firewall to see if incoming connections are allowed for your network type (private) and allow if disabled.

Next, for Windows, Android and iOS 13+ apps, you can enable automatic IP address search and try to sync. If synchronization does not work or you have an older iOS, try the following:
1. Reserve a permanent IP address for the computer with the Windows app. This is done in the Wi-Fi router settings, in the "DHCP" section.
2. Reserve a permanent IP address for the mobile device and add it, if it is missing, in the Windows app settings. You can also open access for all IP addresses (unsafe). If necessary, delete unnecessary IP addresses.
